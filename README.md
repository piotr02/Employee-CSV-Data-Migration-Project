### About the Project

This project has been developed as a team of four during the span of a week. We split our workload and co-ordinated our meetings by the use of agile methodology.




The project's functionality includes being able to read, validate and write CSV Files to databases.

## Getting Started

Simply run this project using IntelliJ Community Edition. Make sure to install the dependencies and implementations listead above.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository below.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/piotr02/Employee-CSV-Data-Migration-Project.git
   ```
2. Either import or run the downloaded file onto IntelliJ.

### Understanding The Program
After running the main method found within CSVMain.java class, an interface
will appear in the console. It allows the user to choose one of 3 options:
'read', 'validate', and 'write'.

Read - reads a csv file and displays the records.

Validate - validates a file, cleaning the records and inserting all
corrupted records into appropriate collections. Displays the number of
records inserted into each collection.

Write - writes records from a file into a database. Allows the user to choose
which writing method to use. Allows for comparison of execution times of
each method.

In order to read data, type 'read'. Then type the name
of the file you wish to read. The program will display
all records within that file.

  ![Reading](reading.jpg)

Each time after finishing an operation, the program
allows to enter another method. Type 'yes' to choose
another method or 'no' to quit.

  ![AnotherMethod](anotherMethod.jpg)

To validate a file, type 'validate'. Then, type the name
of the desired file. The program will validate the chosen
file and display the results.

  ![Validating](validating.jpg)

To insert the records from a file to a database, type
'write'. Then, type the name of the desired file.
Follow the next steps.

  ![Writing](writing.jpg)

After choosing the 'write' method and selecting a file,
choose which method you want to insert the records
into the database with. 

Type 'threadSpeedTest' to compare every method,

'stream' to use a stream,

'parallelStream' to use a parallel stream,

or 'thread (desired number of threads)', e.g. 'thread 8'
to use multithreading.

  ![Inserting](inserting.jpg)

After writing to a database, you can choose to display
all records, a single record, or to continue.

Type 'all' to display all records,

'select (employee id)', e.g. 'select 111800'
to display a single record.

  ![Selecting](selecting.jpg)

Type 'continue' to return to the method selection.

### Project Tour

#### Phase 1 : Created Employee-CSV-Data-Migration-Project and wrote code to read data from a CSV file. Corrupt or duplicated data and records with missing fields,              added to a separate collection for analysis i.e TestCorruptedData.csv,TestDuplicatedData.csv files and TestMissingValuesData.csv file and testes the files with the            help JUnit.
* Duplicate Data
             ![DuplicateData](DuplicateData.png)
* Missing Values
             ![MissingValues](MissingValues.png)
* Corrupt Data
              ![CorruptData](CorruptData.png)
             
#### Phase 2 : Used MySQL Database and created a connection and transferred dates from JAVA to SQL. 
* Created database  from JAVA to Mysql
![Main Method](CreateDatabase.png)

#### Phase 3 : Implemented multiple threads to write the data and compared the execution time. 

* Comparison of the execution time
  ![Thread Execution Time](Threadexecution.png)
  ![Thread Execution Time](graph.png)
#### Phase 4 : Modified code to make use of functional programming concepts â€“ lambdas and streams.

### JUnit Testing

JUnit testing allows us to test the model methods of the project without having to participate in lengthy manual testing.

Effecient use of JUnit Tests will allow us to maintain our program to ensure that it works without any error.

We can find errors by asserting  results and comparing it to the actual result.

Looking at our test coverage, the average % of code coverage is being dragged down by code unsuitable for unit testing. The classes which see most use within the main method of our project have exceedingly high coverage

### Manual Testing

The parts of the program which were not suitable for unit testing were
tested manually multiple times. E.g. user input was tested by entering wrong
values and then trying to make it impossible for the user to break the code by doing so.

The console interface was also heavily tested by trying to input all
possible combinations and incorrect values. Every part of the interface was
tested to check whether the design stayed consistent. This part required
many adjustments as the interface used many classes and methods written by
more than one person.

### Future Development

Outside the time given for this project, we would like to implement a more user-friendly design. This shall allow users to select what outputs they desire such as the amount of corrupted data rather than getting all data.
